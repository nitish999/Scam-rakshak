# Scam rakshak Python Project

## Overview

**Anti_Scammer** is a cybersecurity tool built entirely in Python, designed to **protect elderly and less tech-savvy users** from falling victim to online scams and unauthorized access tools. It focuses on:

- Blocking scam-related **remote access websites**
- Detecting and disabling **suspicious services**
- Logging every action for future tracking and transparency

This project is a part of our **minor project submission**, built by a team of 3 students as part of a cybersecurity-focused learning path.

## Features

### 1. Website Blocker

- Blocks access to known scammer tools like:
  - `anydesk.com`, `teamviewer.com`, `ultraviewer.net`, etc.
- Modifies Windows `hosts` file to redirect these domains to `127.0.0.1`.
- **Log file maintained** to record every site blocked or unblocked.

### 2. Suspicious Service Detector & Blocker

- Continuously monitors background Windows services.
- If a **new or suspicious service** (like remote-control software) appears:
  - Logs it.
  - Immediately stops and disables it.
- Keywords checked include: `"remote"`, `"connect"`, `"control"`, `"viewer"`, etc.

### 3. Site Unblocker

- Safely unblocks previously blocked domains if needed.
- Restores `hosts` file to clean state.
- Logs every unblock action with timestamp.
